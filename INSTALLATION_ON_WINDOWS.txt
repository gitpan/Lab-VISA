Instructions for installing Lab::VISA, Lab::Instrument, Lab::Tools, and dependencies
on a Windows XP system.


0) Work with administrator account during installation.


1) Install VISA (and GPIB drivers) if necessary.
    - download current VISA release from NI (tested with 4.4.1, 4.5.0)
	- run installer
	- check location of visa32.lib (here: C:\Programme\IVI Foundation\VISA\WinNT\lib\msc\visa32.lib)


2) Install compiler
	- Microsoft Visual C++ 
	http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/#webInstall: Visual Studio 9.0


2a) From now on run all commandline programs during installation only from the "Visual Studio Command line"
	(see start menu)


3) Install Perl
	- Tested with ActivePerl, http://www.activestate.com/Products/activeperl/index.mhtml
    - make sure to include Perl Package Manager
	- make sure to activate the check box to include perl directory in PATH variable


4) Install gnuplot 
	- download from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2055 (gp425win32.zip)
	- extract and put it somewhere
	- add directory containing pgnuplot.exe to path:
      My Computer => Properties => Advanced => Environment Variables


5) Install dependencies of our perl modules

	It's easiest to use PPM (Perl Package Manager, included with ActivePerl) to install precompiled modules instead of compiling them yourself!

	Lab::Tools needs:
	- XML::Generator		(PPM would write it as XML-Generator...)
	- XML::DOM
	- XML::Twig
	- YAML

	and their respective dependencies which should be automatically installed by PPM 


6) Install Lab::VISA

	- Unzip/copy sources

	- Adapt LIBS and INC to your installation (see #1); this is what worked for me:

		'LIBS'         => ['-"lC:\\Programme\\IVI Foundation\\VISA\\WinNT\\lib\\msc\\visa32.lib"']
		'INC'          => '"-IC:\\Programme\\IVI Foundation\\VISA\\WinNT\\include"'

	- run the following commands in the source directory

	perl Makefile.PL
	nmake
	nmake install


7) Install Lab::Instrument and Lab::Tools

	- Unzip/copy sources
	- run the following commands in the source directory

	perl Build.PL
	perl Build
	perl Build install


8) Have fun!
