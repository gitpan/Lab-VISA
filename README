VISA
====

This library offers a perl interface to National Instrument's NI-VISA library.

With this library you can easily control the instruments in your lab (multimeters, voltage
sources, magnet sources, pulse generators etc.) from perl. You can perform
complicated measurement jobs with just some perl loops.

It comes even better. The general VISA::Instrument class reduces the
communication overhead to a minimum. And the specialized instrument classes
(virtual instruments) like the VISA::Instrument::HP34401A class offer
even more high level comfort. Everything is set up already, waiting for you to use it.
