=head1 Lab::VISA 

This library offers a perl interface to National Instrument's NI-VISA 
library. 

With this library you can easily control the instruments in your lab 
(multimeters, voltage sources, magnet sources, pulse generators etc.) 
with Perl. You can perform complicated measurement jobs with just some 
Perl loops. 

Even better: The L<Lab::Instrument|Lab::Instrument> class reduces the communication 
overhead to simple read, write and query methods. On top of this, there 
are specialized instrument classes (virtual instruments) such as 
L<Lab::Instrument::HP34401A|Lab::Instrument::HP34401A>, that offer even more high level comfort with 
methods such as read_voltage. 

The L<Lab::Tools|Lab::Tools> package offers classes to simplify the task of logging 
data to disk and maintaining this data.

L<Lab::VISA> is known to work with GPIB, TCPIP and serial connections. Other interfaces
supported by the NI-VISA library are likely to work as well.

=head1 INSTALLATION

This library has been tested to work on Linux and Windows. 

Detailed installation instructions are given in L<Lab::VISA::Installation>.

=head1 FURTHER SUPPORT
